# spuco-george-spurious-correlations

This repository contains a notebook implementing a three-step pipeline
(ERM training, clustering, and group-balanced retraining) to mitigate
spurious correlations on the SpuCoMNIST dataset using the SpuCo package.

The notebook reports both overall accuracy and worst-group accuracy.
